* Use og: tags to give info to facebook
* For some reason embedding doesn't work... the embedded page is downloaded, but then it just shows the "Download File" link.
* sketchfab works fine (e.g. share this link "https://sketchfab.com/models/3nXiIkAd3IlHVNc4hqw4VmaX3tK")
* My test: https://space2.github.io/test_share.html (try to share it on facebook)
